# SpringMVC_Neil
<h4>Training Spring MVC-based application</h4>
<br>The app has test controllers, views, etc.</br>

<br>But the main logic is contained in the web calculator: **http://localhost:8080/first/calculator?a=40&b=10&action=multiplication**, where the values are:</br>
+ **a** - the first operand;
+ **b** - the second operand;
+ **action** - calculator operation (multiplication, division, subtraction, addition).
